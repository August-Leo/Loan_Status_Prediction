The goal of this project is to building a Loan Prediction/Approval system using Machine Learning with Python.

Functional Domain: Banking 

Technical Domain: Predictive Modeling

Algorithms/Approach: Feature engineering,Feature scaling,Logistic Regression,GridSearch, RandomForest with Hyperopt 
#### Note: Used of Hyperopt hyperparameter optimization with random forest resulting improvement in Test accuracy from 0.76 to 0.78,      Also improved AUC Score from 0.84 to 0.86
